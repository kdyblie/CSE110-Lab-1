# A Little About Me

I am from [Oceanside](https://visitoceanside.org/), California, born and raised! I went to Mission Vista High School and graduated in 2018. I am currently a student at University of California - San Diego studying Mathematics - Computer Science. Some of my hobbies are skiing, gaming, and during the summer I'm probably at the beach. During my time in highschool I was fascinated with mathematics, considering pursuring pure math in college. However, during my senior year I was introduced to the world of programming and opted to shift my direction. I started programming my first year of college and looking back have been pleased that I took the leap of faith to do so! Since starting at UCSD I catch my self reciting what appears to be the Professors of the CSE departments favorite saying:
> Start early, start often!
